# How to [complete TaskX]

<!-- For available Markdown syntax, check out https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/ -->

 * This document template is for Howtos that take the reader step by step through completing a particular task that might be encountered while developing an Uno Platform app.
 * Howtos should be sufficiently detailed that a reader following along will, at the end, have a working app which demonstrates the desired end result.
 * Do link to the rest of the documentation, and to the UWP documentation where appropriate.
 * Do link to the final working code. Normally you'll upload it to [Uno.Samples](https://github.com/unoplatform/Uno.Samples).
 * If your tutorial ends up being very long, consider splitting it into multiple pages.

 * Add a short intro explaining who and what your tutorial's for.
